## 1.主动时态

|          | 一般                                                         | 进行            | 完成           | 完成进行             |
| -------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| 现在     | am/is/are <br>do/does                                        | am/is/are doing | have/has done  | have/has been doing  |
| 过去     | was/were<br>did（规则/不规则）                               | was/were doing  | had done       | had been doing       |
| 将来     | will/shall do<br> be (going/about) to do<br>少数用进行表将来 | will be doing   | will have done | will have been doing |
| 过去将来 | would do<br>was/were(going/about)to do                       |                 |                |                      |

**Tips：用进行表将来（也就是用现在进行时或者过去进行时表将来）<br>	用进行表将来主要用于按计划或安排将要发生的动作或事件，多用于表示位置转移的动词（短语），<br>	如：arrive, come, leave, take off, fly等。**

**example：**

* The train is leaving in ten minutes.
* He said that the train was leaving in ten minutes.
